# College-Football-Rankings
College football ranking system written in R that uses specific elo formula to rank teams after various weeks in a schedule. 


Factors that go into the formula include multiplier constant, point differential, wins, losses, and whether team was home/away/neutral. 

Each team starts with an elo of 1500 before the season and elo changes after each game pending on the factors already listed.

Rankings are generated for each subsequent week after week 9.
